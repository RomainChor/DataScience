# Welcome !

## About me
I recently graduated from a Master's degree in Statistics & Data Science at Sorbonne University (Paris).  
I am particularly interested in applications of Machine learning for AI in various fields.  
You can know more about me here: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-chor/)

## What you will find here
You will find some work produced during my degree and helpers I actually use.  

**toolbox.py**: (helper) Python functions for data analysis and inference.    
It is not "perfect" and under continuous modifications.  
Please feel free to give your opinion so I can improve it :)  

**Cassava_classification_challenge folder**: notebooks used for Kaggle "Cassava leaf disease classification" challenge to which I contributed from December 2020 to February 2021. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification)  

**Drugs_consumption folder**: A work, in association with Mohamed Ruine, on the "Drugs consumption" dataset from UCI Machine learning repository. A proper study, with data exploration followed by a classification problem. Various methods used, from boosting to Neural Networks, and advanced aggregation models like stacking. (March 2020)  

**Pegasos folder**: A work around Pegasos and online convex optimization algorithms. Theoretical results, implemetation and simulations on the famous MNIST handwritten digits dataset. (March 2020)
