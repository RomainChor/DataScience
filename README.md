# Welcome !

## About me
Currently preparing a PhD thesis @ Huawei Technologies France & Laboratoire d'informatique Gaspard Monge (LIGM). I am interested in distributed statistical learning, exploring information theoretic and compressibility approaches, through study of theoretical limits & algorithms. More generally, I am eager to learn about exciting scientific topics in various fields.

## What you will find here
You will find some work produced along the recent years and helpers I actually use.  

**toolbox.py**: (helper) Python functions for data analysis and inference.    
It is not "perfect" and under continuous modifications.  
Please feel free to give your opinion so I can improve it :)  

**Generalization_NeurIPS2022 folder**: code for simulations done for a joint work with Sefidgaran M. & Zaidi A. that resulted in an accepted paper @ NeurIPS2022. The work focuses on theoretical guarantees for the generalization error of distributed learning algorithms and shows some improvement from previous works. (June 2022)  

**AI_for_medicine folder**: lecture notes about a Coursera's MOOC on Machine learning for medical diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. (February 2021)  

**Cassava_classification_challenge folder**: notebooks used for Kaggle "Cassava leaf disease classification" challenge to which I contributed from December 2020 to February 2021. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification)  

**Drugs_consumption folder**: A work around the "Drugs consumption" dataset from UCI Machine learning repository. A proper study, with data exploration followed by a classification problem. Various methods used, from boosting to Neural Networks, and advanced aggregation models like stacking. (March 2020)  

**Pegasos folder**: A work around Pegasos and online convex optimization algorithms. Theoretical results, implemetation and simulations on the famous MNIST handwritten digits dataset. (March 2020)  

**no_SQL folder**: lecture notes about several courses on noSQL databases and mongoDB cheatsheets. (March 2021)
