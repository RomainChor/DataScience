# Welcome !

## About me
I am actually achieving a Master's degree in Statistics & Data Science at Sorbonne University (Paris).  
I am particularly interested in applications of Machine learning for AI in various fields.

## What you will find here
You will find some work produced during my degree and helpers I actually use.  

**datascience.py**: (helper) Python functions for data analysis  
It is not "perfect" and is under continuous modifications.  
Please feel free to give your opinion so I can improve it :)
